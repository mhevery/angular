/**
 * Mandatory agreement about unstable APIs.
 *
 * The purpose of this function is to communicate the importance of the fact that developer is about
 * to use unstable APIs. As such Angular team makes no guarantee about the API stability.
 *
 * The agreement is important so that the developer is made fully aware of what they are about to
 * do. Without invoking this function the rest of the APIs will throw an error which prevents their
 * use. Agreeing here also prints a large warning in the console pointing out the experimental
 * nature of the API.
 *
 * ```
 * import {iWantToUseExperimentalAPIs} from `@angular/core/labs`
 *
 * iWantToUseExperimentalAPIs({
 *   iUnderstand: ['not ready for production', 'unstable API']
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @param agreement Correctly formated input stating the agreement must be present. See above.
